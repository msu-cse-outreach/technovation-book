Practice Makes Perfect
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The only way to get good at coding is to practice.

Start simple. 
While you can draw very complex diagrams using just Python Turtle commands, 
the code can be very tedious until you learn some more Python.

The following diagrams are ones that we recommend. 

Mentors will be happy to answer your questions---if you run into any trouble, send a message in the Zoom chat!

Pentagon
---------

.. activecode:: turtle_pentagon
    :language: python
    :nocodelens:

    Write a program to instruct the ``turtle`` to draw a regular pentagon.
    (A regular pentagon has 5 equal-length sides.)

Square Spiral

.. activecode:: turtle_square_spiral
    :language: python
    :nocodelens:

    Write a program to instruct the ``turtle`` to draw a spiralling square similar
    the one shown above.

Five-pointed Star
-------------------

.. image:: img/five-pointed-star.png
    :width: 300
    :align: center
    :alt: Image of a 5-pointed star drawn using Python Turtle


.. activecode:: turtle_five_pointed_star
    :language: python
    :nocodelens:

    Write a program to instruct the ``turtle`` to draw a 
    perfect star with 5 points. 
    (Hint: Each point will need to form a 36 degree angle.)

Nested Squares
---------------

.. image:: img/nested-squares.png
    :width: 300
    :align: center
    :alt: Image of nested squares drawn using Python Turtle--the vertices of each nested square bisect the edges of the immediately enclosing square

.. activecode:: turtle_nested_squares
    :language: python
    :nocodelens:

    Write a program to instruct the ``turtle`` to draw a series of nested squares
    like those shown. 
    
    ~~~~

Be Creative
--------------

Try sketching a simple line-drawing on a graph paper. 
Decide the colors for the lines. 
Count off lengths, calculate angles (or measure with a protractor) and coordinates.
Then begin coding! (Keep it simple or it *will* get tedious. 
But don't dispair, we'll soon learn
standard "coding tricks" to simplify drawing of even complex drawings.)

.. activecode:: turtle_create_own
    :language: python
    :nocodelens:

    Write a program to draw something of your own creation.
