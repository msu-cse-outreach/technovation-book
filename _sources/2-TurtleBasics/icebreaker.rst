Normally, we leave all of the drawing to the python turtle, but today we're gonna give it a try!
This week we'll be putting your artistic skills to the test with
virtual pictionary!

How to play:

* You'll be broken into small groups where your mentor will have a link to your individual groups game. 

* When it's your turn, choose one of 3 words to draw.

* Once you pick a word, you'll have 60 seconds to draw.

* Give the drawing your best shot, and everyone will try to guess what it is.

* If you're not the one drawing, have fun guessing what someone else is drawing.



**Stay on this Runestone page until told to proceed.**
