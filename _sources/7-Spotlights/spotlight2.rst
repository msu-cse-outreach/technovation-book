Spotlight: Zach Lieberman
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Last spotlight, Devan showed us how coding connects to cereal and told how she's found a way to
combine her passion for food with her love for problem-solving as a computer scientist working at General Mills.

As fun as it may sound to write code for the company that makes Lucky Charms, you've got plenty of other options;
computer science can connect to *any* of your passions, no matter how different the two may seem.

Take Zach Lieberman for example—he's found a way to combine his love for art with technology through what he calls
"poetic computing." Zach's work is a prime example of how computer science empowers *creativity*—don't let the
stereotypes tell you otherwise!

Let's hear from Zach himself! As you watch, consider the following questions:

1. What's your passion, and how could it connect to computer science?
2. How could learning to code help you succeed down the road?
3. What's a misconception you had about computer science before Technovation?

Take a few minutes to discuss the questions above in your group, and think about where computer science could take you!
