Spotlight: Hadas
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

One exciting area in which code, technology, and artificial intelligence can make an impact is
healthcareâ€”doctors, nurses and other frontline workers depend on the software written by
computer scientists!

Let's hear from Hadas, a software engineer at Microsoft who's worked on AI-powered healthcare chatbots
and COVID-19 symptom checkers.

Think about the following questions.

1. How did Hadas combine her love for medicine with her love for technology?
2. What's a problem you could solve with computer science?
3. How can learning to code help you solve that problem?
