Spotlight: James Baddiley
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

There are many coders that didn't think about learning how to code until later on in life. James Baddiley was working as an enviornmental consultant when he learned about the lack of resources providing people with information regarding local activies. At 29 years old, he then quit his job and bought a book that taught his how to code.

From here, Chillisauce was born. Chillisauce is an UK event agencey that provides a unique itinerary to help users book events! Baddiley built this website and never once thought it would blow up this big!

Think about the questions below:

1. When did you learn about coding?
2. When did you know you wanted to code?
3. What parts of your life do you think could be improved with code?
