When you're watching an animated movie, do you ever think, "How did they make all of these animations?" How about, "*Who* makes these animations?"

Most people would assume animators, but there's also coders involved!

Fran Kalan is a Technical Director at Pixar Animation Studios.

Think about the questions below:

1. Kalan discusses why she got into code; why did you get into code?
2. Does knowing that code is used for animated movies make you see them differently?
