Spotlight: Luis von Ahn
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Luis von Ahn grew up in Guatamala and grew up relatively poor. When Ahn was 8, his mom wanted him to learn English and saved up to buy him a computer. Ahn excelled in math and science and became the founder of a plethera of games and companies.

But Ahn wanted to create something that everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic class, could use. This is when the app Duolingo was born.

Duolingo is an app that offers free lessons to learn a wide selection of languages. Ahn discusses why he created Duolingo below:

“People who have a lot of money can buy themselves an education like mine, a really good education, whereas people who don't have very much money barely learn how to read and write,” he said. “And therefore, I wanted to give equal access to education.”

Think about the following questions:

1. Have you used Duolingo before?
2. Have you used other apps that also provide users learning oportunities for free?
3. What apps would you create to enhance equal opportunity?
