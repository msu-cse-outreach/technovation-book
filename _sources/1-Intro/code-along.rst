    After pressing play, stop the video and click on the gear icon in the
    bottom right of the video frame.
    Then click *Playback Speed*.
    Finally, click a speed (number) less than 1.
    (The smaller the number, the slower it plays.)

Here's some other terminology that you'll want to become familiar with (click on the 
buttons to read our definitions):

.. reveal:: re-define-program
    :showtitle: A 'computer program'
    :modal:
    :modaltitle: Definition
    
    A computer program: instructions written in a language that a computer
    can interpret to perform some task. 
    
    In other words, a 'computer program' is just another name for 'code'.
    
    Example: "I wrote a computer program to play my favorite card game."
    
.. reveal:: re-define-coding-programming
    :showtitle: 'Coding' or 'programming'
    :modal:
    :modaltitle: Definition
    
    Coding: writing code.
    
    Example: "I am coding a new mobile app."  
    
    Programming: writing a computer program.
    
    Example: "I am programming a new mobile app."
    
    
.. reveal:: re-define-executing-running
    :showtitle: 'Execute code' or 'execute a program'
    :modal:
    :modaltitle: Definition
    
    Execute code: perform the instructions in the code.
    
    Execute a program: perform the instructions in the (computer) program.
    
    Example: "You can see what the program does by executing it."
    
.. reveal:: re-define-running
    :showtitle: 'Run code' or 'run a program'
    :modal:
    :modaltitle: Definition
    
    Run code/a program: another way to say 'execute' the code/program.
    
    Example: "Run the code to see what it does."
    
.. reveal:: re-define-language
    :showtitle: 'Programming language'
    :modal:
    :modaltitle: Definition
        
    Programming language: the vocabulary and grammar rules for writing a program.
    
    Example: "I can write code in several different programming languages."
    

Check your understanding.

.. mchoice:: mc-program-definition
   :random:    

   What do "a computer program" and "code" mean? (Select the best description.) 

   - A series of instructions that a computer can follow to perform some task. 

     + Yes, but not just any old instructions---the instructions must be written using the vocabulary and the grammar rules of a programming language.

   - A TV show

     - No, "a program" sometimes refers to a TV show, but "code" and a "computer program"
       do not

   - A secret language that only some people understand

     - No, "code" sometimes refers to a secret language, but a "computer program" does not

   - A task that a computer can perform.

     - No, but a computer runs a program to perform a task.


The distinctions between these terms can be illustrated by analogy.

Python Turtle Graphics
------------------------

You'll be learning coding using *Python Turtle Graphics*, a library
of code that is written in the Python Programming Language.

To whet your appetite, here's an example program. 
Don't worry about understanding this code
just yet.
But notice what the code looks like --- it combines odd-looking words, punctuation, numbers, 
and math-like symbols.
The way things are indented is important.
We'll learn the rules for writing code like this in the weeks ahead.

Then click the "Run it" tab to see what running the code produces.

To get practice running code and see what you can learn by doing so, perform
the following experiments.

Experiment #1

- Show the code (press ``Show Code``) to reveal an *Active Code Editor*, which will let you modify the code and then re-run it.
    
- Scroll down in the active code editor to line 39. Then change the ``3`` in this line to ``4``. 
    
- Run the code again. (You may have to hide the code first to enable the ``Run`` button.)
    

Experiment #2
    
- Change the ``4`` that you entered in line 39 to ``2`` and run the code another time.
    
.. shortanswer:: sa-reflect-sierpinski1
    :optional:
    
    Based on these experiments, 
    what do you think the computer uses the number in line 39 for? 
    (Suggestion: Use the slider above the editor and re-run the earlier
    versions of the code to remind yourself what each version does.)
    
Experiment #3

- If the number in line 39 isn't still ``2``, change it to be ``2``
    
- In line 38, the first number in the second pair of numbers is ``0``; change this ``0`` to ``-100``.  (This will make the middle pair be ``[-100,100]``.)

- Run the program again.
        
Experiment #4

- In line 38, change the first number in the middle pair of numbers to ``150``.  (This will make the middle pair of numbers be ``[150,100]``.

.. shortanswer:: sa-reflect-sierpinski2

    Based on these experiments, 
    what do you think the computer uses
    the middle pair of numbers in line 38 for? 
    (Suggestion: Use the slider above the editor and re-run the earlier
    versions of the code to remind yourself what each version does.)   

Other Experiment suggestions:

- Experiment with changing the first or third pairs of numbers in line 38. 
    
- Experiment with changing the names of the colors in lines 18 and 19.

    What did you learn from your additional experiments?
    

Isn't it amazing how much you can learn about code just by playing around with it?

By the end of club, you will understand a lot more about how the
code in this example works!
