        Think about how you might fix it. Then try again! This same recipe works for

What is Coding?
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Listen to Mike's rap about coding to learn his answers to:

- :red:`What` is code?

- :blue:`Who` codes?

- :purple:`Why` learn code?

    :modal:
    :modaltitle: How to change a video's speed

    After pressing play, stop the video and click on the gear icon in the
    bottom right of the video frame.
    Then click *Playback Speed*.
    Finally, click a speed (number) less than 1.
    (The smaller the number, the slower the video plays.)
 
Think for a minute about what each of the following means in a dicussion of computing. 
Then click on the buttons to compare our definitions with yours:

.. reveal:: re-define-program
    :showtitle: Computer program
    :modal:
    :modaltitle: Definition

    **Computer program:** A list of instructions that is written in a language a computer can interpret to perform some task.

    So a *computer program* is just another name for *code*.

    :blue:`"I wrote a computer program that plays my favorite card game."`
    
    :blue:`"She wrote code that calculates the minumum, maximum, and average temperatures recorded each month."` 

.. reveal:: re-define-coding-programming
    :showtitle: Coding, Programming
    :modal:
    :modaltitle: Definition

    **Coding:** In the process of creating code.

    **Programming:** In the process of creating a computer program.
    
    So *programming* is just another way of saying *coding*.

    :blue:`"I am coding a new mobile app."`

    :blue:`"I am programming a simulation of the known universe."`


.. reveal:: re-define-executing-running
    :showtitle: Run, Execute
    :modal:
    :modaltitle: Definition

    **Run [code]**: Carry out the instructions in the code.
   
    **Execute [a program]**: Carry out the instructions in the program.
    
    So *run the code* is just another way of saying *execute the program*. 

    :blue:`"To see what code does, just execute it."`
    
    :blue:`"The program crashed when I tried to run it.`
    
    (This last sentence is something you will eventually get used to!)


.. reveal:: re-define-language
    :showtitle: Programming language, Coding language
    :modal:
    :modaltitle: Definition

    **Programming language:** The vocabulary and grammar rules for writing a program.

    **Coding language:** The vocabulary and grammar rules for code.
    
    So a *programming language* is just another way of saying a *coding language*.

    :blue:`"Once you learn one programming language, it is relatively easy to teach yourself others."`
    
    :blue:`"What is your favorite coding language to program in?"`

Check your understanding.

.. mchoice:: mc-program-definition
   :random:

   What do *a program* and *code* mean when used in computing? 
   (Select the best description.)

   - A series of instructions that a computer can carry out to perform some task.

     + Yes, but not just any old instructions---the instructions must be written using the vocabulary and the grammar rules of a programming language.

   - A TV show.

     - No, *a program* sometimes refers to a TV show, but not in computing; and *code* does not; and *code* certainly does not refer to a TV show.

   - A secret language that only some people understand.

     - No, *a program* does not refer to a secret language; and although *code* sometimes refers to a secret language, in computing it generally means the same as *a program*. 
     
   - A task that a computer can perform.

     - No; You run a program to perform a task, but the *program* is not the task that is to be completed.


.. mchoice:: mc-programming-definition
   :random:

   What does *programming language* and *coding language* mean when used in computing? 
   (Select the best description.)

   - Universal rules that you can use for any program.

     - No, there are different rules that you use for different programming languages. The rules aren't univeral across languages!

   - A programming language and a coding language are two separate things.

     - No, although they may be different terms, they are the same thing.

   - The rules and grammar used to write a program.

     + Yes, these rules differ across each coding languages, although most are pretty similar!
     
   - A lanugage that only your computer understands.

     - No, although the coding language is understood by the computer, the user also understand it too!




To understand the distinctions between these terms, it can help to draw 
analogies with activities that you are already familiar with. Work through the exercises below with your instructor.
