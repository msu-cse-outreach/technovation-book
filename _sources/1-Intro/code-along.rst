    Finally, click a speed (number) less than 1.
    (The smaller the number, the slower the video plays.)
 
Think for a minute about what each of the following means in a dicussion of computing. 
Then click on the buttons to compare our definitions with yours:

    :showtitle: Computer program
    :modal:
    :modaltitle: Definition

    **Computer program:** A list of instructions that is written in a language a computer can interpret to perform some task.

    So a *computer program* is just another name for *code*.

    :blue:`"I wrote a computer program that plays my favorite card game."`
    
    :blue:`"She wrote code that calculates the minumum, maximum, and average temperatures recorded each month."` 

.. reveal:: re-define-coding-programming
    :showtitle: Coding, Programming
    :modal:
    :modaltitle: Definition

    **Coding:** In the process of creating code.

    **Programming:** In the process of creating a computer program.
    
    So *programming* is just another way of saying *coding*.

    :blue:`"I am coding a new mobile app."`

    :blue:`"I am programming a simulation of the known universe."`


.. reveal:: re-define-executing-running
    :showtitle: Run, Execute
    :modal:
    :modaltitle: Definition

    **Run [code]**: Carry out the instructions in the code.
   
    **Execute [a program]**: Carry out the instructions in the program.
    
    So *run the code* is just another way of saying *execute the program*. 

    :blue:`"To see what code does, just execute it."`
    
    :blue:`"The program crashed when I tried to run it.`
    
    (This last sentence is something you will eventually get used to!)


.. reveal:: re-define-language
    :showtitle: Programming language, Coding language
    :modal:
    :modaltitle: Definition

    **Programming language:** The vocabulary and grammar rules for writing a program.

    **Coding language:** The vocabulary and grammar rules for code.
    
    So a *programming language* is just another way of saying a *coding language*.

    :blue:`"Once you learn one programming language, it is relatively easy to teach yourself others."`
    
    :blue:`"What is your favorite coding language to program in?"`

Check your understanding.

.. mchoice:: mc-program-definition
   :random:

   What do *a program* and *code* mean when used in computing? 
   (Select the best description.)

   - A series of instructions that a computer can carry out to perform some task.

     + Yes, but not just any old instructions---the instructions must be written using the vocabulary and the grammar rules of a programming language.

   - A TV show

     - No, *a program* sometimes refers to a TV show, but not in computing; and *code* does not; and *code* certainly does not refer to a TV show.

   - A secret language that only some people understand

     - No, *a program* does not refer to a secret language; and although *code* sometimes refers to a secret language, in computing it generally means the same as *a program*. 
     
   - A task that a computer can perform.

     - No &mdash; You run a program to perform a task, but the *program* is not the task that is to be completed.


To understand the distinctions between these terms, it can help to draw 
analogies with activities that you are already familiar with.

Python Turtle Graphics

    Animation of a Turtle following a series of instructions


You'll be learning coding using *Python Turtle Graphics*, a library
of code that is written in the Python Programming Language.


To whet your appetite, here's an example program in a Runestone *active code* widget.

.. activecode:: ac-example-sierpinski-triangle
  :nocodelens:
  :above:
  :enabledownload:
  :caption: Sierpinski Triangle
  :chatcodes:

  Don't worry about understanding this code
  just yet.
  But notice what it looks like --- the code has odd-looking words, punctuation, numbers,
  and math-like symbols. They all mean something to the computer.
  So does the indentation.
  We'll learn the rules for writing code like this in the weeks ahead.

  The white area in the active code widget is an *editor*. You can scroll through
  the code if you place your cursor into editor. You can change the size of the
  editor by dragging the bottom-left corner up and down.
  You can also modify the code.
  But don't do that just yet!

  For now, just scroll the contents in the window and resize the editor so
  the ``Run`` button is at the top of the window and you can see a
  good four inches or more below the editor. (To scroll the window contents,
  place your cursor outside the editor.)

  Then click the ``Run`` button to see what running the code produces.
  After pressing ``Run``, you need to scroll down below the code editor to see
  what the program draws.

  def drawTriangle(points,color,myTurtle):
      myTurtle.fillcolor(color)
      myTurtle.up()
      myTurtle.goto(points[0][0],points[0][1])
      myTurtle.down()
      myTurtle.begin_fill()
      myTurtle.goto(points[1][0],points[1][1])
      myTurtle.goto(points[2][0],points[2][1])
      myTurtle.goto(points[0][0],points[0][1])
      myTurtle.end_fill()

  def getMid(p1,p2):
      return ( (p1[0]+p2[0]) / 2, (p1[1] + p2[1]) / 2)

  def sierpinski(points,degree,myTurtle):
      colormap = ['blue','red','green','white','yellow',
                  'violet','orange']
      drawTriangle(points,colormap[degree],myTurtle)
      if degree > 0:

                          getMid(points[1], points[2])],
                     degree-1, myTurtle)
          sierpinski([points[2],
                          getMid(points[2], points[1]),
                          getMid(points[0], points[2])],
                     degree-1, myTurtle)

  def main():
    p1 = [-100,-50]
    p2 = [0,100]
    p3 = [100,-50]
    bisect_num = 3

    myWin = turtle.Screen()
    myPoints = [p1,p2,p3]
    sierpinski(myPoints,bisect_num,turtle)
    myWin.exitonclick()

  main()

To get practice running code and see what you can learn by doing so, perform
the following experiments.

Experiment #1

- Scroll down in the editor (white area containing the program) to line 39.
  Then change the ``3`` in this line to ``4``.

- Run the code again.

- Notice the differences between the what the first program draws and what the
  modified program draws. (Use the slider at the top of the active code editor
  to go back and forth between the two programs and re-run them as needed. This
  slider keeps a *history* of all the code you execute so you can always go back
  to an earlier version if you make a mistake or just want to remember what
  it looks like.)

Experiment #2

- Change the ``4`` that you entered in line 39 to ``2`` and run the code another time.

- Notice the differences between the three versions of the program. (Again, you
  can use the slider to go back and re-run any of the versions that you'd like.)

.. shortanswer:: sa-reflect-sierpinski1
    :optional:

    Based on these experiments,
    what do you think the computer uses the number in line 39 for?

Experiment #3

- If the number in line 39 isn't still ``2``, change it to be ``2``

- In line 37, change the ``0`` to ``-100``.  (This will make the instruction be ``p2 = [-100,100]``.)

- Run the program again.

- Notice how this modification changes what the program draws.

Experiment #4

- In line 37, change the ``-100`` to ``150``.  (This will make the instruction be ``p2 = [150,100]``.)

- Run the program again.

- Notice how this modification changes what the program draws.

.. shortanswer:: sa-reflect-sierpinski2
    :optional:

    Based on these experiments,
    what do you think the computer uses
    the pair of numbers in line 37 for?
    (Suggestion: Use the slider above the editor and re-run the earlier
    versions of the code to remind yourself what each version does.)

Other Experiment suggestions:

- Experiment with changing the pairs of numbers in lines 36 and 38.

- Experiment with changing the names of the colors in lines 18 and 19.

    What did you learn from your additional experiments?

Isn't it amazing how much you can learn about code just by playing around with it?

By the end of club, you will be able to design and code diagrams like this yourself!  |smiley-heart-eyes|
